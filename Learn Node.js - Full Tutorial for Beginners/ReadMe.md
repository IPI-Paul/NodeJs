Learn Node.js - Full Tutorial for Beginners
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RLtyhwFtXQA
This is the fourth tutorial I have watched to gain more knowledge of using nodeJs. Again, I have added a globals.js file to the root folder to provide a path varaible to modules installed globally. It also exports functions and variables that provide file naming and director path conventions relating to the folder structure being used.

Although I used Eclipse Neon to initiate the project, I have used Visual Studio Code Insiders through-out. 

As the version of the joi module I installed gloablly is later than the version being used in the video tutorial, there are code changes I have made that try best to follow the tutorials relating to joi.
