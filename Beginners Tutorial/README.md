NodeJs Full Tutorial for Beginners 
Whilst trying out the new Windows 11 on my laptops and setting up a working development environment, I installed NodeJs, as usual.  I have never actually used NodeJs or studied it for more than an hour in the past, so it was about time to get familiar and be aware of what it offers.

The collection of files are taken from the video tutorial at https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=q-JVfek1fc0 and some adaptions were made to have file system structures the way I prefer.

The index.js; index.ejs; and index.json files are my own development after following this course and offer a webserver and main page to view a table of the tutorial scripts with linked documents populated an iframe and displaying each code.
