Learn back-end development with Node.js and Express
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mG1L7C4y2c0

This is the third tutorial I have watched to gain more knowledge of using nodeJs. I felt from the start that I would prefer to install all additional modules globally, rather than the suggested methods that obviously make it easier to ship each package with their dependancies listed. For that to work, I added a file called globals.js to the route and exportedt a constant that makes a call to the child_process module to get the path to my global files. I have listed all globally installed node modules at the top of the app.js file. 

I have also used Windows 11 Windows Subsystem for Linux to install and host PostgreSql. Although not the best when it comes to code hints, I used Eclipse Neon as my IDE.

I have used the knowledge gained from this tutorial to add validation and display functions and files to fill in the gaps where later examples had a more developed function to earlier ones. So making the earlier examples as functional. I have also downloaded the suggested jquery and css files to ensure that everything runs offline (locally).
