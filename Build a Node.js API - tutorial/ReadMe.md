Build a Node.js API - tutorial

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fsCjFHuMXj0

This is the fourth tutorial I have watched to gain more knowledge of using nodeJs. Again, I have added a globals.js file to the root folder to provide a path varaible to modules installed globally.

I used Eclipse Neon to initiate the project, as it gives me access to previous projects but have used Visual Studio Code Insiders from then on.

As the version of the mongodb module I installed gloablly is later than the version being used in the video tutorial, there are code changes I have made that try best to follow the tutorials relating to mongodb.

I have used Robo 3T - 1.4 to manage the MongoDb server I installed on Ubuntu inside the Windows Subsystem for Linux with Windows 11. And, Insomnia 2021.6.0 to test the API responses.
