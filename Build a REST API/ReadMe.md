Build a REST API with Node, Express and Mongo
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ka5fYysBM

This is the second tutorial I have watched to gain more knowledge of using nodeJs. I felt from the start that I would prefer to install all additional modules globally, rather than the suggested methods that obviously make it easier to ship each package with their dependancies listed. For that to work, I called the child_process module to get the path to my global files when needing to require one. I have listed all globally installed node modules at the top of the index.js file. 

I have also used Windows 11 Windows Subsystem for Linux to install and host MongoDb. Although not the best when it comes to code hints, I used Eclipse Neon as my IDE. I also used other applications suggested in the tutorial to test the API and have ensured that everything runs offline (locally)
