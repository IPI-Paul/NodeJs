NodeJs Web Scraping

this is the fifth tutorial i have watched to gain more knowledge of using nodeJs.


Unfortunately a some of the modules installed with this tutorial were indicated as depracated, which may explain 
the error messages received when trying to run the tutorial code. The errors occured when retrieving the body with the cheerio module. 

On top of that, the website being used as an example has changed considerably. So, I have changed the code to 
use json values found when traversing the website and return something similar to the tutorial result.
